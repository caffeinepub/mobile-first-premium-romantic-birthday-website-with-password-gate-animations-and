      "id": "REQ-15",
      "text": "Update the Image Memory section so each image card (both front image side and back message side) renders in a fixed 2:3 aspect ratio (width:height), replacing the current 4:3 aspect ratio sizing.",

      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Each ImageMemoryCard displays at a 2:3 aspect ratio on the front side (image/placeholder) and the back side (message).",
        "The 3D flip interaction still aligns correctly (front/back faces overlap and match dimensions).",
        "Image upload, Replace/Add button placement, and Adjust/Save framing interactions still work and remain usable at the new aspect ratio.",
        "No changes are made to the Video Memory section (it should remain 2:3 as already implemented)."

  "constraints": [
    "Frontend changes must not modify any files under frontend/src/components/ui or other paths listed as immutable in SYSTEM_CONTEXT.",
    "Do not introduce new backend services or databases; image memory sizing is a frontend-only change."
  ],
  "nonGoals": [
    "Changing the number of image cards, memory persistence behavior, or the flip animation style beyond what is required to support the 2:3 aspect ratio.",
    "Altering user-facing text/copy in the Image Memory section."
