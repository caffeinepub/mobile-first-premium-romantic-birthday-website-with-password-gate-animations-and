# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Update Image Memory cards to render at a fixed 2:3 (width:height) aspect ratio on both sides of the flip card.

**Planned changes:**
- Change the Image Memory grid/card sizing from the current 4:3 layout to a fixed 2:3 aspect ratio for each ImageMemoryCard.
- Ensure the 3D flip front/back faces remain perfectly aligned and identical in dimensions at the new ratio.
- Verify and adjust (as needed) the placement/usability of image upload, Replace/Add controls, and Adjust/Save framing interactions within the new 2:3 container.
- Leave the Video Memory section unchanged (it remains 2:3).

**User-visible outcome:** Image Memory cards appear in a consistent 2:3 shape, and flipping/adding/replacing/adjusting images continues to work normally without affecting Video Memory.
