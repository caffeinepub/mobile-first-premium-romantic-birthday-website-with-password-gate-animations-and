  "summary": "Diff updates ImageMemoryCard to use a 2:3 aspect ratio on the front face via Tailwind `aspect-[2/3]`. However, the diff excerpt is truncated before showing the back face and flip-face alignment details, so full REQ-15 acceptance criteria cannot be conclusively verified from the provided summary. No evidence of changes to the Video Memory section is shown in the modified file list.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Ensure both sides of each ImageMemoryCard (front image/placeholder and back message) render in a fixed 2:3 aspect ratio and that the 3D flip interaction keeps the faces perfectly overlapped and matching dimensions.",
      "reason": "The diff snippet clearly shows `aspect-[2/3]` applied to the front face, but the file content is truncated before any back-face markup/classes are visible, so there is no direct evidence that the back face also uses 2:3 sizing and matches the front for proper 3D flip alignment.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Image upload, Replace/Add button placement, and Adjust/Save framing interactions remain usable at the new 2:3 aspect ratio.",
      "reason": "While the snippet includes upload handling and drag-to-adjust framing handlers, the truncation prevents confirming the full UI (e.g., Add/Replace label continuation, Save/Adjust controls, and their placement) remains usable/layout-correct under the new aspect ratio.",
